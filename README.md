# DB Browser for SQLite Country code stats exporter

This is a simple command line utility to export the DB Browser for
SQLite download and activity stats, by country code, to a SQLite
database.

Created mainly as it's an interesting data set, and useful as a demo
data source for [Choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map).
